## Implementation Plan

### Architecture Overview
The game will be built as a client-side web application using:
- HTML5 Canvas for rendering
- WebRTC for peer-to-peer communication
- Google STUN servers for NAT traversal
- Matrix-based stage definition for easy level creation

### Technical Components
1. **Game Engine**: Custom 2D engine with fixed timestep game loop
2. **Physics System**: Simple gravity and collision detection
3. **Networking Layer**: WebRTC data channels for real-time communication
4. **Stage System**: JSON matrix defining platforms, obstacles, and spawn points
5. **Rendering System**: Canvas-based sprite rendering with static camera

### Data Flow
1. Players connect via WebRTC using signaling server
2. Game state synchronized through data channels
3. Each client renders all players based on received positions
4. Input handled locally, position broadcast to peers
5. Collision detection performed on each client

### Stage Matrix Format
```javascript
{
  "width": 20,
  "height": 15,
  "tileSize": 32,
  "spawn": [2, 12],
  "tiles": [
    [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],
    // ... matrix rows
    [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]
  ]
}
```
Where: 0 = empty space, 1 = solid platform, 2 = spawn point
